A Loan Type contains details about:

  * The maximum loan amount that can be provided against a loan of this loan type
  * The yearly rate of interest
  * The penalty interest rate
  * The grace period in days until which penalty will not be levied after the payment due date.
  * “Is Term Loan” specifies whether a loan is Term Loan Or Demand Loan. If  this is unchecked any loan of this type will be considered as a Demand Loan and automatic repayment schedule won’t be generated for that loan.
  * The various account details that will be used during the loan process can also be mentioned in the loan type

> Demand Loans are open ended loans which do no have a fixed repayment schedule or a fixed repayment amount.
